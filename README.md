## How the Game Works
The game has 8 levels, and on each level, you play as two characters, the MIT beaver and the iQuHACK duck. Initially you can control each character separately with the up/down arrows and the 'w'/'s' keys. The objective is to avoid hitting any of the obstacles with either character. At certain points in the game you can pick up special entanglement items which connect thhe two characters. The two characters, when entangled, can jump higher and duck lower, allowing for a wider range of obstacles to be passed, but their movements are synched. Dying during a level brings you back to the start screen, and the goal is to get to the end of each level.

Our goals were to make a fun game that utilized various quatum computing techniques and python programming.
## What's Next?
In creating this game, we were clearly limited by time, and in the future we could add additional

Check out some info in the [event's repository](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021) to get started.

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!
