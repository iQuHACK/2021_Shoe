# Quantum Beaver Run
Jonathan Shoemaker, Jessica Shoemaker, and Emily Shoemaker
## How the Game Works
The game has (currently) 3 levels, and on each level, you play as two beavers. Initially you can control each character separately, using the up/down arrows to jump/duck for the lower beaver and the 'w'/'s' keys to jump/duck for the upper beaver. The objective is to avoid hitting any of the obstacles with either character. At certain points in the game you can pick up special pink entanglement items which connect thhe two characters. The two characters, when entangled, can jump higher and duck lower, allowing for a wider range of obstacles to be passed, but their movements are synced. Dying during a level brings you back to the start screen, and the goal is to get to the end of each level.
## Motivation/Goals
We created this game with the intent to invent a new spin on the classic horizontal scroller game. The Quantum aspect of our game is unique, and it makes gameplay harder to predict and more complex in nature. Our goals were to make a fun game that utilized the idea of entanglement to make gameplay more complex.
## What We Did
Utilizing pygame and quantum computation, we created the app as described above. We allow you to choose a level in the terminal, which then navigates to the horizontal scroll screen, and from there we could run the quantum entanglement code as described. 
## What's Next?
In creating this game, we were clearly limited by time, and in the future we could add additional levels and quantum aspects. One additional aspect we were picturing was phase entanglement in which the two characters would do the same movements but in phases. Given more time we could add more gate aspects into the program and potentially create additional probabilistic aspects in the gameplay. We would also like to improve the visuals, adding a main menu screen rather than selection via text in the terminal.
