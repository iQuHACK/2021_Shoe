## How the Game Works
The game has 8 levels, and on each level, you play as two characters, the MIT beaver and the iQuHACK duck. Initially you can control each character separately with the up/down arrows and the 'w'/'s' keys. The objective is to avoid hitting any of the obstacles with either character. At certain points in the game you can pick up special entanglement items which connect thhe two characters. The two characters, when entangled, can jump higher and duck lower, allowing for a wider range of obstacles to be passed, but their movements are synched. Dying during a level brings you back to the start screen, and the goal is to get to the end of each level.
## Motivation/Goals
We created this game with the intent to invent a new spin on the classic horizontal scroller game. The Quantum aspect of our game is unique, and it makes gameplay harder to predict and more complex in nature. Our goals were to make a fun game that utilized various quatum computing techniques and python programming.
## What We Did
Utilizing pygame and quantum computation, we created the app as described above. We were able to get a level select screen that navigated to the horizontal scroll screen, and from there we could run the quantum entanglement code as described.
## What's Next?
In creating this game, we were clearly limited by time, and in the future we could add additional levels and quantum aspects. One additional aspect we were picturing was phase entanglement in which the two characters would do the same movements but in phases. Given more time we could add more gate aspects into the program and potentially create additional probabilistic aspects to the games programming.

Check out some info in the [event's repository](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021) to get started.

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!
